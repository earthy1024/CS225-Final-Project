Final Project
Link to full dataset: http://snap.stanford.edu/data/amazon0302.html
The above dataset can only be used on a linux terminal. To unzip the file using the command "gzip -d 'filename'" in the command line.

# Build
The project has only been tested on linux, it may not work on Windows. 
To execute a directed and unweighted graph data of your own, switch out the filename in the MakeGraph call in main.cpp and swap with your own.
To compile the project type "make" in the terminal. This will produce an executable called "finalproj". To run the executable, type "./finalproj" in the terminal. This will create the graph and run the algorithms and finally create the data output files.
